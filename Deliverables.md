## Objective

Develop a web application with an admin panel for managing employee insurance data.
Showcase skills in API calls, data handling, data clustering, and admin panel creation.

## Functionality

### Data Extraction

- Use Zoho Creator API to fetch employee insurance data (Employee ID, Insurance Type, Department, Type of Leave, Start Date, End Date, Car Number, Insurance Company, Premium, Gross Premium, Reason).
  - Handle potential empty fields ("Not found").

### Data Processing & Clustering

- Clean and pre-process the extracted data.
- Cluster the data based on relevant fields (e.g., department, insurance type).
- Choose an appropriate data structure (JSON, XML, YAML) to store the clustered data.

### Admin Panel

- Develop a web interface with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing the clustered data.
- Users should be able to:
  - View all clustered data.
  - Search and filter data based on different criteria.
  - Add new data entries.
  - Edit existing data entries.
  - Delete data entries.
